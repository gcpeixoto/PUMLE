function xv = value(x, flatten)
%Remove AD state and optionally compact 1 by n cell arrays to matrices
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%    v = value(V);        % Flatten cell arrays with single row, multi col
%    v = value(V, false); % Don't flatten cell arrays
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Removes AD variables, and if the input is a cell array with a single
%   row and multiple columns, will combine them into a single matrix.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   v       - Value to be converted.
%
% OPTIONAL PARAMETERS:
%   flatten - If true, any cell array inputs with a single row will be
%             converted to a double matrix:
%             {a, b} will be become [value(a), value(b)],
%             but {a; b} will remain as {value(a); value(b)}
%
% RETURNS:
%   v       - Value with no AD status.
%

%   double2ADI, double2GenericAD, ADI, GenericAD
