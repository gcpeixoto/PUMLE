function c = findEnclosingCell(G, pt, cells)
% Find cell(s) containing points. The cells must be convex.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   c = findEnclosingCell(G, pt)
%   c = findEnclosingCell(G, pt, cells)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G  - Valid grid structure with normals, face and cell centroids. The 
%        cells must be convex.
%
%   pt - Set of point coordinates, represented as an n-by-dim array.
%
% OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
%   cells - Subset of grid cells, either as cell indices or a logical mask.
%           Default is cells = 1:G.cells.num
%
% RETURNS:
%   c  - Set of grid cells. Specifically, c(k), k=1:n, contains pt(k,:). If
%        a point lies on the boundary between two cells, the function 
%        returns the smallest index. c(k) is zero if the point is not
%        found.

%   `pebi`.
