function reports = postprocessStates3D(G, states, rock, fluid, schedule, res_water, res_gas)

% This function is a wrapper that calls 'postprocessStates' on a result from a 3D
% simulation. It takes the result of a simulation ('states', a cell array of
% states for each timestep), and returns a corresponding structure array of
% 'reports'.  The prepared report contains each timestep state, but also
% other information such as the computed plume heights and the trapping state
% of the CO2.
%
% Reports are needed as input to generate inventory plots using
% 'plotTrappingDistribution'. 
% 
% Currently, only rate controlled wells are supported (not pressure-controlled).
% 
% SYNOPSIS:
%   function reports = postprocessStates3D(G, states, rock, fluid, schedule, traps,
%   res_water, res_gas)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G         - 3D simulation grid used in the simulation
%   states    - result from the 3D simulation (cell array of states, including
%               initial state)
%   rock      - rock object used in the simulation
%   fluid     - fluid object used in the simulation
%   schedule  - schedule used in the simulation (NB: only rate controlled
%               wells supported at present)
%   res_water - residual water saturation
%   res_gas   - residual co2 saturation
%
% RETURNS:
%   reports - a structure array of 'reports', one per timestep in the 
%             simulation.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `plotTrappingDistribution`, `postprocessStates`
