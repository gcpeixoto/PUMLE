function [curve, sill, range] = ...
       estimateSemivariogram1D(x_cell, fx_cell, num_curvepts, max_reldist, rel_radius)
%
% Estimate semivariogram from one or more sets of sampled 1D data
% 
% SYNOPSIS:
%   function [curve, sill, range] = ...
%      estimateSemivariogram1D(x_cell, fx_cell, num_curvepts, ...
%                              max_reldist, rel_radius)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%
% This function estimates the semivariogram associated with a set of 1D
% correllated noise, which is assumed to be of mean 0.  It does so by computing
% all the mutual distances and value differences between pairs of data
% points, sorting into bins and computing means.
% 
% If more than one set of sampled 1D data is available, the function can work
% with multiple sets, as datasets are provided as cell arrays (see parameter
% description below).
% 
% PARAMETERS:
%   x_cell      - cell array with one or more sets containing the x-positions of
%                 the 1D data
%   fx_cell     - cell array with one or more sets containing the sample
%                 values of the 1D data
%   num_curvepts - The number of points on the variogram curve to compute
%   max_reldist - The maximum extent of the semivariogram curve to compute
%                 (as relative propotion of maximum distance in line data).
%                 This extent may be shortened within the algorithm if a definite
%                 sill is encountered at a shorted distance.
%   rel_radius  - Width of averaging window used when computing each point on
%                 the semivariogram curve.  The width is given in units of bin
%                 width (where each bin has the width of the max length of
%                 the semivariogram curve, divided by number of curvepoints
%                 (num_curvepts). 
%
% RETURNS:
%   curve - Variogram curve presented as a vector of regularly sampled values
%   sill  - maximum value encountered (where curve flattens)
%   range - the distance from origin to the distance value where the sill is
%           encountered 
%
% EXAMPLE:
%   For an example of use, refer to the script 'test_estimate_variogram'
