function [params, history] = mle_prob_param(samples, distr_fun, distr_fun_grad, init_p, pmin, pmax) 
%
% Maximum likelihood estimation of probability function parameters based on a
% number of measured samples.
% 
% SYNOPSIS:
%   function [params, history] = mle_prob_param(samples, distr_fun, distr_fun_grad, init_p, pmin, pmax)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
% Based on a number of samples ('samples'), which are supposedly drawn from a
% known probability distribution with unknown parameter(s), estimate the
% parameters that would yield the maximum probability of the given sample to
% be drawn.
% 
% PARAMETERS:
%   samples            - N samples drawn from the probability distribution
%   distr_fun          - function representing the probability distribution.
%                        The function should take two arguments (x, p) where x is 
%                        the argument to the distribution function and p the parameter(s)
%                        to be estimated
%   distr_fun_grad     - function representing the gradient of the distribution.
%                        It should take the same arguments as 'distr_fun'.
%   init_p             - initial guess for the parameter(s)
%   pmin               - minimum allowed value(s) for the parameter(s)
%   pmax               - maximum allowed value(s) for the parameter(s)
%
% RETURNS:
%   params  - the maximum-likelihood-estimation of the parameter(s), given
%             the samples

   % numerical performance for distributions from the exponential family.  Such
   % distributions vanish so fast that their tails quickly become numerically equal
   % to zero, which may lead to problem when searching for optimal parameters.
