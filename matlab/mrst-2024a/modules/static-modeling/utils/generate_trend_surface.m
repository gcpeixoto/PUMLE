% Generate a spline approximating surface ("trend surface") from a set of
% scattered points, and sample it into a regular grid.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   function [x, y, zgrid, surf] = generate_trend_surface(points, num_coefs, samples, stiffness)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   points    - Nx3 array with coordinates of N scattered 3D-points (must be
%               projectable to a surface in the (x, y) plane).
%   num_coefs - Number of knot intervals in x and y coordinates (u and v parameters)
%   samples   - resolution (x and y direction) of sampled regular grid
%   stiffness - stiffness parameter, defining the tradeoff between surface
%               regularity and approximation quality
% RETURNS:
%   x     - x-coordinates for zgrid
%   y     - y-coordinates for zgrid
%   zgrid - sampled grid from approximating surface
%   surf  - spline surface approximating the scattered points
