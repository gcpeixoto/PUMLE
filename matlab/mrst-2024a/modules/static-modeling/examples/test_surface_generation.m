% In this example we demonstrate how to generate a continuous bivariate
% function (which can be regarded as a 2Â½D function) from a set of scattered
% sampled points, using the 'generate_trend_surface' function

%% making noisy, scattered sample points using the MATLAB logo function

% In order to generate a set of sampled points from an 'unknown' surface, we
% sample from a function readily available in MATLAB, namely the membrane
% function used in the MATLAB logo.

refsurf = membrane(1, 100);
refsurfarray = refsurf(:);

% sampling 1000 random points from the surface
num_pts = 1000;

x_ixs = ceil(rand([num_pts, 1]) * size(refsurf, 1));
y_ixs = ceil(rand([num_pts, 1]) * size(refsurf, 1));
z_val = refsurfarray(sub2ind(size(refsurf), x_ixs, y_ixs));

points = [x_ixs, y_ixs, z_val];

% We add some artificial noise, to pretend these points were obtained through
% some imprecise measurement process.  
zspan = max(z_val) - min(z_val);
noise_level = 0.02; % standard deviation 2% of full z span
noise = randn([num_pts, 1]) * noise_level * zspan;

noisy_points = points;
noisy_points(:,3) = points(:,3) + noise;

% plotting exact points (red) and noisy points (blue)
clf;
plot3(points(:,1), points(:,2), points(:,3), '.r'); hold on;
plot3(noisy_points(:,1), noisy_points(:,2), noisy_points(:,3), 'b.');

%% Generating "loose" surface from scattered points, using least squares

% The generated surface should not be forced to pass through the sample
% points, since the samples are noisy and we also care about regularity.

% Surface 'stiffness' is regulated by the 'stiffness' parameter.  The
% 'num_coefs' specify how many degrees of freedom are used to describe the
% surface in each parameter direction (control points in the underlying
% tensor product spline surface)

[num_coefs, stiffness] = deal(30, 1e-8); % this is a very low stiffness
num_samples = 200;  % We will sample the surface as a regular grid.
                    % 'num_samples' here describes the number of grid points
                    % in x and y.

% generating surface using the 'generate_trend_surface' function.  We are
% here mainly interested in the sampled grid 'zgrid', but the function also
% return the abscissae of the gridpoints, as well as an object representing
% the spline surface itself, 'splinesurf'.  The latter is an instance of a
% 'BivariateSplineFunction'.

                           num_samples, stiffness);


% We plot the resulting surface.  We note that while the surface is good at
% approximating the samples, it is very irregular in shape.

%% Generating surface from scattered points, using multilevel B-spline algorithm

% The 'generate_trend_surface' function is based on global optimization and
% least squares.  A less costly alternative when working with high resolution
% surfaces can be to use the heuristic MBA algorithm, as described in the
% paper [10.1109/2945.620490] (Wolberg and Shin, 1997).  We here demonstrate
% its use on the same set of noisy samples used above

box = [min(noisy_points(:,1)), min(noisy_points(:,2)), ...
       max(noisy_points(:,1)), max(noisy_points(:,2))];

mbaspline = scattered_point_approximation(noisy_points, 5, [2,2], box, false);

% The function only returns the spline object, so in order to create a grid,
% we have to sample it from the spline function ourseles
x = linspace(box(1), box(3), num_samples);
y = linspace(box(2), box(4), num_samples);
   
[U, V] = ndgrid(x, y);

zgrid = reshape(mbaspline.evaluate([U(:), V(:)], 0, 0), num_samples, num_samples);
 
% plot surface
