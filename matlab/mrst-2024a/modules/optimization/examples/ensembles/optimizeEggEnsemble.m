%% Run an expected NPV-optimization over a subset of the Egg-ensemble 
% NOTE: this example requires ~40 simulations and adjoint runs of
% realizations from the Egg ensamble. The optimization can be cancelled 
% (or killed) at any stage, and be continued at a later time by rerunning 
% the script. Required simulation-, gradient- and objective values are saved 
% in mrstOutputDirectory(). 
%
% The example optimizes the mean (expected) NPV for the selected
% realizations. The optimization procedure is based on a version of the
% generalized reduced gradient (GRG) method, which computes gradients both
% for well target controls and well upper/lower simulation limits. Hence,
% both targets and limits (that become active during at least one
% simulation) are adjusted to optimize the objective.
