%% Ensemble-based calibration of network models of Egg using ES-MDA
% The aim of this example is to calibrate an ensemble of GPSNet type
% network models to match reference well data from a full Egg model. To do
% so, we generate network models using flow diagnostics on each of the
% realizatons from the Egg ensemble. This ensemble will then act as our
% prior, and we use ES-MDA to obtain a posterior parameter distribution. We
% consider the mean of these parameter as the calibrated model parameters.
% 
% The model is a water-oil reservoir, and we calibrate pore volumes,
% transmissibilities, and well production indices.
% 
% Note that this example builds heavily on the ensemble module in MRST.
%
% This example was first introduced in MRST 2021b.

%% Define the network 
% We create a network model which we will calibrate according to the
% reference data. Since we at this point do not have any information about
% the flow paths in the model, we define our network model to connect all
% injectors with all producers with single 1D flow paths. 
%
% We split each flow path into ten cells and define a computational 2D grid
% in which each flow path is represented with a single row. We use the same
% fluid model as in the full reference model.
%
% Since the pore volume, transmissibilities, and well production indices
% will be calibrated through an ensemble, the corresponding values in the
% reference model defined here will not be used. We therefore assign dummy
% values for these parameters.
%
% The model is structured according to the TestCase class, which
% integrates directly into the ensemble module.
% For details, see the function injector_to_producer_network.m

%% Create sample object with initial networks obtained through flow diagnostics
% We obtain the prior distribution of the model parameters from building
% network models of realizations 1 to 100 from the full models in the Egg
% ensemble. With eight injectors and four producers we have a network
% consisting of 32 connections, and we assign homogeneous pore volumes and
% transmissibilities for each connection. The network models will therefore
% have 32 parameters of each of the two parameters.
%
% Here, we can choose between using flow diagnostic analysis of
% either the 3D geological model (preproccessing) or the fine-scale
% reference simulation (postprocessing).
%
% Since the flow diagnostics analysis will only identify communications
% between a subset of all injector-producer pairs, the ensemble members
% will consist of networks of different sizes and shapes. We therefore map
% all the resulting networks back to the injectors-to-producers network.
% The closed connections are given parameters that ensure valid
% simulations, but that give negligible contribution to the fluid flow.
%
% For initial values for the well production indices, we use the mean
% contribution from the perforated cells of the full model as the value for
% the single perforated cell in the network model. An alternative is to use
% the sum of the perforated cells, and we compute (and store) both for
% convenience.
%
% We store the initial ensemble parameters in the appropriate Sample
% objects designed for history matching from the ensemble module. For 
% this, we use a class that are designed specifically for network models
% for holding the relevant parameters. We also specify maximum and minimum
% allowed values to avoid that simulations break down due to nonphysical
% configurations.

%% Create QoI object and define observation uncertainty

% some noise or uncertainty, and history matching algorithms, such as
% ES-MDA, is constructed to calibrate model parameters with respect to the

% reference data to be exact, but we still need to give a measure of the

% simulation strategy, etc. More information about input parameters can be 
% found in the base class MRSTEnsemble.m.

% The maxWorkers argument determines the maximum number of simultaneous 
% processes which will be used to simulate the ensemble. Increasing this
% number will increase the number of processes used, but care must be taken
% to ensure that your computer is capable of handling this number of 
% processes. Specifying too high a number will result in high memory usage
