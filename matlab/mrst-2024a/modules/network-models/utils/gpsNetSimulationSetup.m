function setup = gpsNetSimulationSetup(gpsNet,iSchedule)
% Sets up a complete simulation problem for a GPSNEt model
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%     setup = gpsNetSimulationSetup(gpsNet, schedule);
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%
% The function takes GPSNet model and fine-scale simulation schedule as
% input, converts this schedule so that it can be used on the GPSNet, and
% generates a simulation setup structure for the GPSNet that holds the
% simulation model, the converted schedule, and initial data. This setup
% can be passed on to the evaluateMatch function from the optimization
% module.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   gpsNet   - An instance of the GPSNet class that provides the
%              description of the GPSNet model
%
%   schedule - A simulation schedule defined on the fine grid whose
%              behavior the GPSNet tries to mimic.
%
% RETURNS:
%   setup    - A simulation setup for the GPSNet model corresponding to the
%              given simulation schedule.
% 
% SEE ALSO:
%   GPSNetModel, evaluateMatch
