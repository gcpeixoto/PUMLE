function example = makeRandomTraining(example, rScale, bhpScale, shutin)
% Random perturbation of an existing simulation schedule
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%    problem = makeRandomTraining(example, rScale, bhpScale, shutin)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%    The function takes a simulation problem as input and makes a random
%    perturbation of the well controls so that a subsequent simulation will
%    excite a larger variation in reservoir states and well responses. Each
%    sequence of constant well controls is subdivided into groups of four
%    steps. Each of these groups, except for the first, is given a random
%    perturbation around the existing well control. This means that if a
%    given control is valid for less than four consecutive steps, it will
%    not be perturbed
%
% INPUT PARAMETERS:
%    problem - Self-contained packed simulation problem which can be passed
%              to a number of routines, e.g:
%                 - simulatePackedProblem: Simulate and store output.
%                 - getPackedSimulatorOutput: Retrieve results.
%                 - simulatePackedProblemBackground: Simulate in seperate
%                   thread.
%              The function will change the simulation schedule found in
%              the 'schedule' field of the problem.
%
%    rScale -  Scaling of rate controls, either a scalar value or a
%              function handle. Scalar values are converted into a function
%              handle of the form
%                rscale = @(x,r) (1 + 2*rscale*(x-.5))*r
%              and then applied to a uniformly distributed random number x
%              and the original rate r. To replace this perturbation by
%              another custom made one, the user can instead pass a
%              function handle to an appropriate function.
%
%    bhpScale - Same as the rScale parameter, but applied to bhp controls
%
%    shutin  - Boolean variable. Specifies whether the perturbations
%              should include shut in of wells.
%
% RETURNS:
%    problem - a self-contained problem
%
% EXAMPLE:
%    % Load a standard Norne test case and perturb the rates by 25% and the
%    % bottom-hole pressure controls by 5%
%    trueEx  = TestCase('norne_simple_wo');
%    trainEx = makeRandomTraining(trueEx, 0.25, 0.05, false);
