function wellSols = getWellSolsFromWellboreState(model, states, wbname)
%Extract the wellbore states from a set of states of a simulation with a CompositeModel where one of the models is a WellboreModel
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   wellSols = getWellSolsFromWellboreState(model, states)
%   wellSols = getWellSolsFromWellboreState(model, states, wbname)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   This function extracts properties from state.Wellbore for each state
%   in states and converts it to a the standard wellSol format of MRST. The
%   resulting wellSols can be used in e.g., plotWellSols.
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   model  - Instance of CompositeModel where one of the submodels
%            is a WellboreModel
%
%   states - States from a simulation with the model
%
% OPTIONAL PARAMETERS:
%   wbname - Name of the wellbore model as defined in
%            model.submodels.(wbname). Default: Wellbore
%
% RETURNS:
%   wellSol - Well solution structure array
%
% NOTE:
%   The WellboreModel is currently only compatible with GeothermalModel
