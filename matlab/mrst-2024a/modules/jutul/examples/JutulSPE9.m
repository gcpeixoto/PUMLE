%% Example demonstrating SPE9 run in Jutul
% This example runs the model from the SPE9 benchmark, which was posed
% twenty years ago to compare contemporary black-oil simulators (Killough,
% 1995). The reservoir is described by a 24 x 25 x 15 grid, having a 10
% degree dipping-angle in the x-direction. The 25 producers initially operate
% at a maximum rate of 1500 STBO/D, which is lowered to 100 STBO/D from day
% 300 to 360, and then raised up again to its initial value until the end
% of simulation at 900 days. The single water injector is set to a maximum
% rate of 5000 STBW/D with a maximum bottom-hole pressure of 4000 psi at
% reference depth. This setup will cause free gas to form after ~100 days
% when the reservoir pressure is reduced below the original saturation
% pressure. The free gas migrates to the top of the reservoir. During the
% simulation most of the wells convert from rate control to pressure
% control. A second problem is a discontinuity in the water-oil capillary
% pressure curve, which may cause difficulties in the Newton solver when
% saturations are changing significantly.
%
% The example simulates the setup using both Jutul and MRST and compares
% the results from these simulators with precomputed simulation results
% from ECLIPSE.  will be slight differences in well responses because
% wells are modelled differently in the two simulations. MRST uses a
% standard Peacemann well model, whereas Jutul uses multisegment wells with
% property tables interpolated and exported from MRST.

% that already has JutulDarcy preloaded. Once this simulation is finished,
% you can hit the return button to continue execution in MATLAB. Notice
% that the first time you run the simulation, it will take a long time
% since Julia has to compile necessary code. Once compiled, however, the
% simulation is fast.
