%% First introductory example to Jutul as a MRST accelerator
% JutulDarcy is a reservoir simulator written in Julia by SINTEF Digital
% based on the Jutul solver framework, developed for high-performance
% testing of new simulator concepts. We can thus set up a case in MRST and
% run it in Jutul for increased computational performance. Jutul supports
% black-oil, immiscible, and compositional models with multisegment wells.
%
% To install Jutul, you must first install the latest version of Julia [1].
% Once installed, run Julia and add the JutulDarcy package. If you are
% interested in using Julia for other things, we recommend adding it to an
% environment[2]. Otherwise, you can add it to the default environment by
% running the following command in the Julia prompt:
%
% using Pkg; Pkg.add("JutulDarcy")
%
% Once downloaded, you are ready to run this example. Note that the example
% pauses once the simulation is ready to be run in the Julia terminal.
%

%% Write case to disk and output Jutul command
% The routine will write the MRST setup to disk in a *.mat file and then
% output a command you can paste into an existing Julia session that
% already has JutulDarcy installed. Once the resulting simulation is
% finished, you can hit the return button to continue execution in MATLAB.
% Notice that the first time you run the simulation, it will take a long
% time since Julia has to compile necessary code. Once compiled, however,
% the simulation is fast for all subsequent calls in that session.
pth = writeJutulInput(state0, model, schedule, name);
disp('Pausing - run the command in Julia and hit any key to continue')
pause()

%% Once simulated, read back as MRST format
[ws, states] = readJutulOutput(pth);

%% Simulate MRST for comparison purposes
nls = getNonLinearSolver(model);
[ws_m, states_m] = simulateScheduleAD(state0, model, schedule, 'NonLinearSolver', nls);

%% Compare the results
% The two simulators use somewhat different well models: MRST is set up
% with a standard Peacemann well model while Jutul uses multisegment wells
% by default based on tables generated from MRST.  This can give certain
% differences for high flow rates, e.g., in the near-well region. This is
% particularly evident during the initial transitional phase for the SPE10
% example.
