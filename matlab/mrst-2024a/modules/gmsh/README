This repository contains a matlab script for converting meshes in the
Gmsh format to MRST grids.

Gmsh can be found at
https://gmsh.info

There are numerous examples of grids shipped with Gmsh. See the
gmsh/examples and gmsh/tutorials folders found in the source code.

The converter in this directory needs the Gmsh grids written in an
m-file format. This can be done in the python interface by
`gmsh.write("grid.m")` or in the GUI by saving as a file with
extension `.m`.
