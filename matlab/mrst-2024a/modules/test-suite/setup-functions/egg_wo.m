function setup = egg_wo(varargin)
% Setup function for the Egg benchmark models
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   setup = egg_wo('pn1', pv1, ...)
%   setup = egg_wo(fullSetup, 'pn1', pv1, ...)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Setup of a single model realization from the Egg ensemble; see J.D.
%   Jansen et al., The egg model - a geological ensemble for reservoir
%   simulation, Geoscience Data Journal 1.2 (2014): 192-195. The Egg
%   ensemble contains 101 realizations of a small fluivial reservoir with a
%   perimeter the loosely resembles an egg (hence the name). Each
%   realization  is represented on a 60x60x7 corner-point grid, out of
%   which 18 553 cells are active.
%   
%   The reservoir is produced under waterflooding conditions with eight
%   water injectors operating and constant rate and four producers
%   operating at constant bottom-hole pressure. The oil-water system
%   follows a relatively simple black-oil model with weak compressibility,
%   cubic and quartic relative permeabilities curves, and 5 cP and 1 cP
%   viscosities for the oil and water phases, respectively.
%
%   The only configurable parameter is:
%      'realization' - realization number (default: 0, range: 0 to 100)
%
% RETURNS:
%   setup - test case with the following fields: name, description,
%      options, state0, model, schedule, and plotOptions.
%      If the optional input fullSetup (see synopsis) is false, the
%      returned setup only contains name, description, and options.
