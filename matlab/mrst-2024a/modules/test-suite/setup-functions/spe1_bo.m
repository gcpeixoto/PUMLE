function setup = spe1_bo(varargin)
% Setup function for the first SPE Comparative Solution Project (SPE 1)
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   setup = spe1_bo('pn1', pv1, ...)
%   setup = spe1_bo(fullSetup, 'pn1', pv1, ...)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Setup for the first SPE Comparative Solution Project (A.S. Odeh,
%   Comparison of solutions to a three-dimensional black-oil reservoir
%   simulation problem, J. Pet. Technol., 33(1):13-25, 1981, doi:
%   10.2118/9723-PA).
%
%   The reservoir model is represented on a 10x10x3 Cartesian grid and
%   describes gas injection into an undersaturated oil (i.e., an oil that
%   can dissolve more oil). Although this is essentially a two-phase
%   gas-oil case, it is represented as a three-phase problem with a water
%   phase having relative permeability virtually equal zero over the whole
%   saturation range. The reservoir is produced by a gas injector and a
%   bhp-controlled producer, placed on opposite ends of the diagonal.
%   Simulation of this case is discussed in more detail in section 11.8.1
%   of the first MRST textbook (Lie, Cambridge University Press, 2019, doi:
%   10.1017/9781108591416).
%
%   Configurable parameters: none.
%
% RETURNS:
%   setup - test case with the following fields: name, description,
%      options, state0, model, schedule, and plotOptions.
%      If the optional input fullSetup (see synopsis) is false, the
%      returned setup only contains name, description, and options.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   TestCase, testcase_template, testSuiteTutorial, spe3_bo.
