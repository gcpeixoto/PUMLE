function setup = norne_simple_wo(varargin)
% Setup function for a water-oil ensemble version of the Norne field
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   setup = norne_simple_wo('pn1', pv1, ...)
%   setup = norne_simple_wo(fullSetup, 'pn1', pv1, ...)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Setup of a simplified water-oil ensemble model of the Norne field. The
%   reservoir geometry is from the full simulation model published by the
%   Open Porous Media (OPM) project. Petrophysical data are generated using
%   geostatistical routines developed in a paper by Lorentzen et al, SPE J,
%   2019, doi: 10.2118/194205-PA, but without inclusion of some of the
%   random parameters that modify connectivity across faults.
%
%   The production scenario is greatly simplified compared with the real
%   field and describes immiscible waterflooding into a reservoir that
%   initially is fully filled with oil. On purpose, the wells are placed
%   and controlled so that one of the producers will dominate the overall
%   field production.
%
% RETURNS:
%   setup - test case with the following fields: name, description,
%      options, state0, model, schedule, and plotOptions.
%      If the optional input fullSetup (see synopsis) is false, the
%      returned setup only contains name, description, and options.
