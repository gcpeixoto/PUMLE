function setup = spe9_bo(varargin)
% Setup function for the ninth SPE Comparative Solution Project (SPE 9)
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   setup = spe9_bo('pn1', pv1, ...)
%   setup = spe9_bo(fullSetup, 'pn1', pv1, ...)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Setup for the ninth SPE Comparative Solution Project (J.E. Killough,
%   Ninth SPE Comparative Solution Project: A reexamination of black-oil
%   simulation, 1995 SPE Reservoir Simulation Symposium, doi:
%   10.2118/29110-MS).
%
%   The test case models a water-injection problem in a highly
%   heterogeneous reservoir consisting of fourteen unique layers having
%   isotropic, lognormally distributed permeability spanning six orders of
%   magnitude. The reservoir geometry is described by a 24x25x15 regular
%   grid with a 10-degree dip in the x-direction. The live-gas, black-oil
%   model has several challenging features including strong kinks and steep
%   gradients in the relative permeability and the water-oil capillary
%   pressure curves.  Other challenges include transition from
%   undersaturated to saturated state, abrupt changes in prescribed
%   production rates, and dynamic switching between rate and bhp control
%   for the producers.
%
%   The model is so large that we replace the standard AD backend in MRST
%   by a more optimized row-major version.
%
%   Simulation of this case is discussed in more detail in section 12.4.4
%   of the first MRST textbook (Lie, Cambridge University Press, 2019, doi:
%   10.1017/9781108591416).
%
%   Configurable parameters: none.
%
% RETURNS:
%   setup - test case with the following fields: name, description,
%      options, state0, model, schedule, and plotOptions.
%      If the optional input fullSetup (see synopsis) is false, the
%      returned setup only contains name, description, and options.
