function N = findMatchingFaces(G)
%Find indices of faces sharing the same set of nodes in a grid
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   N = findMatchingFaces(G)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G       - Grid structure as described by grid_structure.
%
% RETURNS:
%   N       - An n x 2 array of face numbers. Each row represents a pair of
%             faces in G that share the same set of nodes.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%  `makeInternalBoundary`, `removeInternalBoundary`
%
% EXAMPLES:
%   % Make internal boundary, find matching faces, remove boundary again
%   G = cartGrid([3,2]);
%   G = makeInternalBoundary(G, 13);
%   N = findMatchingFaces(G);
%   G = removeInternalBoundary(G, N);
