# TODO

Remarks and annotations to remember.

- `wells_list` is still unused. For the moment, experiments are executed with a single well with fixed settings. To change it, modify directly `co2lab3DPUMLE.m`, section `Well selection`.

- Convergence problems are possibly being caused by high injection rates. Acceptable ranges should be analyzed later.

Tasks

- [] Create setup.ini in batch mode for repetitive runs.
